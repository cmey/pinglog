## Example output
![Alt text](/generated/pinglog.png?raw=true "Ping log")

Here I'm trying to show that my home ISP connexion has "holes" where I don't have Internet: it shows up as pings of 5 to 30 **seconds**.  At the same time, I'm showing that my local network works fine: ping to the router from my computer is fast (< 1ms) and has no "holes".  So it's a problem past my router ("box").
